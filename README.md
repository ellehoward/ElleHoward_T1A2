## Portfolio Overview: 

The purpose of my portfolio is two-fold: to initally demonstrate my understanding of taught concepts to educators, and then eventually (after further development) to provide potential employers or businesses with an example of my style, capabilities, personality, work background and creativity. I have designed my site with accessibility and user experience in mind, with content formulated and placed to engage both audiences and to encourage "goal conversion" of visitors (with the goal being that visitors click on a contact/call/email button). I have designed the site considering "mobile-first" method, paying special attention to responsiveness and accessiblity.

### Portfolio Target Audience:
As mentioned previously, the target audience of my site is educators and prospective employers/freelance clients. The primary media will most likely be mobile devices, but this site is responsive for major device sizes including desktop.

###  Design and Functional Features: 

My portfolio consists of the following pages: Home, About, Blog, and Contact which are linked from the main nav menu. Two further pages, Work and Projects, are able to be navigated from text links on the the About page. The purpose of the site is to encourage visitors to a) contact me and b) download my resume, in the hope that I will gain employment and/or further work or contacts from it. The number of links on the nav have been purposefully limited, as four links was what worked best considering customer goals, mobile browser use and ease-of-navigation for all users.

I have been thoughtful with my use of components, links, text and imagery, with regard to clarity, engagement and user flow.

**My Main Website Components are as Follows:**

Navbar/Main Menu:
 - Each webpage has a navbar component, which appears identically at the top of each webpage, allowing users to move through the site with ease.
 - Accessibility is a priority with the use of semantic HTML, along with clear fonts and contrasting colours as recommended by the latest WCAG standards.
 - As an interest-grabber, the nav buttons change colour to gold and a file folder effect appears on mouse-hover.

Footer: 
- The footer is fiex at the bottom of all pages and contains social links and a copyright message. 
- Accessibility/screen readers are also considered with use of semantic HTML, clear fonts and contrasting colours.
- The footer's icons (Twitter, Linkedin, Github) have a colour change effect on mouse hover, for a bit of interest.

Image Styling on About Me: 
- There are two image effects on this page: rounded bio image and "polarioid-style" images with a transform effect on hover.
- Semantic HTML and Alt text are both used to improve accessiblity
- Images are responsive and move to different positions depending on screen size. Text also wraps differently around the image to suit each layout.
 
Blog Post "Cards":
- The blog post cards are a specific "brochure" style cards to mimic a travel brochure design.
- Blog posts contain an image with a caption, along with introductory text and a link.
- Accessibility is promoted through semantic HTML, captions and alt tags.
- Blog post cards are responsive, clear and easy to read on all devices.

**Other Noteworthy Additions

Buttons and Links: 
- Each page has a clear call-to-action button link, or several, which encourage click-throughs and avoid page bounce. These button links are repeated throughout the site, so as to acquaint/educate the user and encourage familiarity with links. All button links also have a hover effect to add interest.

###  Sitemap
The homepage is the sites landing page and from there all other sites are navigated to via the navbar at the top of the screen.
